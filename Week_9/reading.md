## Further reading on open issues in neuroscience

* [Rule et al. (2019) "Causes and consequences of representational drift"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.08.005). Synapses are in a state of continual turnover in the brain, unlike our theories of learning. How can we understand stable perception and behaviour in the light of this?
* [Pastuzyn et al. (2018) "The Neuronal Gene Arc Encodes a Repurposed Retrotransposon Gag Protein that Mediates Intercellular RNA Transfer"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.024). Neurons can transfer packets of RNA to each other. How does this change our picture of learning?
* [Stringer et al. (2019) "Spontaneous behaviors drive multidimensional, brainwide activity"](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav7893). A huge amount of the variability of neural responses in visual cortex can be explained by knowing the facial muscle movements (in mice). Does this mean that the brain is much more entangled than previously thought? See also [Pessoa (2022) "The Entangled Brain"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544603/the-entangled-brain/).
